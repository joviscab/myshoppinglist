# Odin Project Extra - My Shopping List!

## Who am I? What is this?

Hello, my name is Joviscab and this is part of my learning to code journey!

This an extra project called My Shopping List, that is part of the Foundations Course of The Odin Project. The idea of this project is to put to practice all the Javascript knowledge that I have acquired until now. In this project I am going to build a Shopping List website.

## Skills

With this project my idea is to check the Javascript (DOM Manipulation) skills that I have learned until now, as well as using it as an exercise to remember all the lessons until this point.
